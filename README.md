# LimesurveyRails

A limesurvey plugin for Rails to make an ActiveRecord model able to participate to Limesurvey surveys

## Premise

This is a very very poor readme. I use this gem in my projects but I can't describe it better because I'm busy. But if anyone is interested just contact me 

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'limesurvey_rails'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install limesurvey_rails

## Usage

In your participant model simply add

  is_a_limesurvey_participant

but there are many options ..
